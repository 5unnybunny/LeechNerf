You can now die during leech ampule if your health reaches 0.  
The duration reduced from 10 seconds to 6 seconds.  
Teammate heal reduced from 10% to 5%.  
Health segments reduced from 10 to 5.  
You can't self revive with the ampule anymore.

Version 4  
Kills during ampule required to get godmode and heal increased from 2 to 5.  
  
Version 5  
Ampule cooldown is now 60 seconds.

Overkill nerfed leech so it takes 2 health chunks if damage is over 200, so I'm returning back the 10 health segments.
